## How to play

The game is played by using the WASD or arrow keys to move the squares up, left, down, or right 
respectively. The moving squares will move to the next possible squares. Two squares will merge if 
they are the same value, but will not merge with a square that was generated from merging squares in 
the same action. The merge square will be in the next free square location. Moving squares will take 
priority over merging squares and so squares will move before merging. Each merge square value adds 
to the current score of the game. The objective is to achieve the highest scores.

## This Clone

This clone is meant as a "From Scratch" application. While the original is written for the web with
html, css, and js, this application is built using C++ and personal libraries: [LinAlg](/linalg/README.md)
and [Geometry](/geometry/README.md) along with third party libraries [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/),
[OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/), [glad](https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad), and [FreeType](https://freetype.org).
The foundation was meant to be as barebones as possible without making the application horrifying to
create.
